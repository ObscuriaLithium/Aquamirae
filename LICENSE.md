# Copyright © Obscuria. All Rights Reserved.

-----

All projects developed by Obscuria are distributed under an All Rights Reserved license, with limited permissions granted as explicitly defined below. Any use outside the permitted scope requires prior written authorization from the copyright holder.

## 1. Permitted Uses

1. **Modpacks**. Inclusion of the original, unmodified mod files in CurseForge and Modrinth modpacks, including monetization through the official author reward programs of these platforms.
   - Modifications within modpacks are permitted only when implemented through external hooks, mixins, or similar runtime mechanisms.
   - The original mod files must always be loaded by the user directly from official distribution sources, and runtime modifications must not attempt to rebrand or misrepresent the project.
2. **Content Creation**. Creation and publication of video or streaming content (e.g., YouTube, Twitch, or similar platforms) featuring the mods, including monetization through standard platform features such as ads, memberships, or donations.
3. **Servers**. Use of the original, unmodified mod files on non-commercial servers.
4. **Community Contributions**. Forks, pull requests, bug reports, feature requests, or other contributions are welcome, provided they are intended as collaborative input into the official project and not for independent redistribution or rebranding.

## 2. Prohibited Uses

1. **Unauthorized Redistribution**. Uploading, hosting, or distributing the mod files outside of CurseForge or Modrinth without explicit permission.
2. **Rebranding or Derivatives**. Releasing independent projects, forks, or modified versions of the code or assets (textures, models, sounds, etc.) under a different name or branding.
3. **File Modification**. Distributing modified versions of the original mod files (e.g., JARs) is prohibited. All modifications must be performed at runtime as described in Section 1.
4. **Monetization**. Direct monetization of the mod files, source code, or assets in any form, except as expressly permitted in Section 1. This includes hosting on donation or fundraising platforms (e.g., Patreon, Ko-fi) when tied directly to redistribution of the mod.
5. **Source Code Misuse**. Partial or full use of the source code, assets, or other project materials in other projects without explicit written permission.

## 3. Commercial Use

Commercial use of Obscuria’s intellectual property is strictly prohibited except as permitted in Section 1 (e.g., modpacks with CurseForge/Modrinth author rewards, video monetization).
For any other commercial inquiries (such as partnerships, licensing, or independent projects based on the mods), explicit written authorization from Obscuria is required.

## 4. Community and Open Source Clarification

The source code of Obscuria’s projects may be publicly accessible to encourage community collaboration. However, public access does not grant redistribution, relicensing, or rebranding rights. Contributions are welcome and encouraged, but the intellectual property remains under an All Rights Reserved license.
